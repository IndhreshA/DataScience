## Overview

This repository is dedicated to hands-on data science projects that leverage popular Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Each project demonstrates the end-to-end data science workflow: data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and insights.

## Features

- End-to-end data science workflows
- Clean and well-commented Jupyter Notebooks
- Data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning
- Real-world datasets from various domains
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model evaluation

## Projects & Datasets

- **Economic Trends Analysis:** Explore datasets related to economic indicators and inflation.
- **Bank Customer Churn:** Predict customer churn using demographic and transactional data.
- **Car Price Predictions:** Build regression models to estimate car prices based on features.
- **Cell Phone User Behavior:** Analyze patterns in cell phone usage and predict user segments.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IndhreshA/DataScience.git
    cd DataScience
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

- Explore the `notebooks/` directory for Jupyter Notebooks with detailed analyses.
- Run scripts in the `scripts/` directory for standalone data processing or modeling.
- Place datasets in the `data/` directory as required by each project.
- Open notebooks with Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions inside.
